## Pipe Up

This module replicates the functionality of the pipe (|) operator, allowing users to pass in executable names as command line arguments.

## Building

```shell
make
```

## Running

```shell
./pipe ls sort cat
```
I ran the command inside the git repo directly after building my program and it sorted and printed out all the files in the repo. 

Result:
Makefile
pipe
pipe.c
pipe.o
README.md
test_lab1.py



## Cleaning up

```shell
make clean
```
